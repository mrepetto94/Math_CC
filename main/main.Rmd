# Essentials of Set Theory

## What is a set?
A set may be seen as a collection of elements. The following 

$$ S = \{a,b,c\} $$ 

is said to be a set. In particualr we are talking about the set $S$ with elements $a$ $b$ and $c$.

## Be carfull
The order is not important meaninig that given two vectors:
$$ A = \{1,2,3\} \quad B = \{1,3,2,1\} $$
$$ A = B $$

# Essentials of Set Theory II

## Let's elaborate it a little more...
The notation we used previously is usefull with short sets but what about big sets and infinite sets? We need to use  a different notation defining the property of the set:
$$ B = \{(x,y):px + qy \leq m, x \geq 0, y \geq 0\} $$

## Set Membership
$$ x\in S \quad x\notin S $$
$$ A \subseteq B $$

# Essentials of Set Theory III

## Exercise
Try to state the properties of the **even** number set.

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE}

```
# Essentials of Set Theory IV

## Set operations
| Notation      | The set that consists of the elements that: |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------|
| $$A \cup B$$  | belong to at least one of the sets $A$ and $B$|
| $$A \cap B$$      | belong to both $A$ and $B$|
| $$A \setminus B$$ | belong to set $A$, but not to $B$|
| $$ A^c $$ | do not belong to set $A$|

##Tips and tricks
For a small number of sets you can use Venn diagramms as a visual help!


# Essentials of Set Theory V (Exercises)
## 1.1.5 Determine which of the following formulas are true. If any is false, find a counter example to demostrate this.
(a) $A \setminus B = B \setminus A$
(b) $A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq (A \cap B) \cup C$ 
(c) $A \cup (B \cap C) \setminus (A \cup B) \cap C$
(d) $A \setminus (B \setminus C) = (A \setminus B) \setminus C$

## 1.1.6 Use the Venn diagrams to prove that: 
(a) $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ 
(b) $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$

# Some Aspects of Logic

##Propositions
Are assertions that are either true or false.

*Eg: all individuals who breathe are alive* **TRUE proposition**

*Eg: all individuals who breathe are healthy* **FALSE proposition**

##Implications
Implications are used to keep track of the logical chain reasoning.

*Eg: $P \implies Q$* **is read as if $P$ then $Q$**

*Eg: $P \iff Q$* **is read as $P$ if and only if $Q$**

# Some Aspects of Logic II

## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
Taking the last example

$$ P \implies Q $$

$P$ is a **sufficient condition** for $Q$

$Q$ is a **necessary condition** for $P$

$$ \overbrace{P}^{\text{Living in Paris}} \underbrace{\implies}_{\text{If then}} \overbrace{Q}^{\text{Living in France}}$$

# Some Aspects of Logic III (Exercises)
## 1.2.2 Determine which of the following formulas are true. I any formula is false, find a counter a counter example to demonstrate this.
(a) $A \subseteq B \iff A \cup B = B$
(b) $A \subseteq B \iff A \cap B = A$ 
(c) $A \cap B = A \cap C \implies B = C$
(d) $A \cup B = A \cup C \implies B = C$
(e) $A = B \iff (x \in A \iff x \in B$

# Some Aspects of Logic IV (Exercises)
## 1.2.5 For each of the following proposition, state the negation as simply as possible.
(a) $x \geq and y \geq 0$ 
(b) All $x$ satisfy $x\geq a$
(c) Neither $x$ nor $y$ is less than $5$
(d) For each $\epsilon \geq 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $B$ is satisfied
(e) No one can help liking cats
(f) Everyone loves somebody some of the time

# Mathematical Proofs

##Characteristics
Looking on what argued by Thomas Tymoczko, three are the main features of a mathemetical proof:

1. Convincingness

2. Surveyability

3. Formalizability

##Direct proof
We start with the premises $P$ and work forward to $Q$

##Indirect proof
We are going backwards supposing $Q$ is false and proving the falseness of $P$

# Mathematical induction
Direct and indirect proof are a both examples of deductive reasoning (we use the rules of logic to prove something). Inductive reasoning moves from a different assumption meaning that we can establish certain conclusions by observations.

# Algebra

## The Real Numbers
- Natural numbers $N=..., -2,-1,0,1,2,...$
- Rational numbers $Q= \{x : x=\frac{a}{b}, a \in N, b \in N\}$
- Irrational numbers

## 2.1.1 Explain why the infinite decimal expansion below is not a rational number

$1.01001000100001...$

# Integer Powers

## Definition

$$a^n=\overbrace{a \cdot a ... a}^{n}$$
$$a^{-n}=\overbrace{\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{a} ... \frac{1}{a}}^{n}$$
