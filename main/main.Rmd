# Essentials of Set Theory

## What is a set?
A set may be seen as a collection of elements. The following 

$$ S = \{a,b,c\} $$ 

is said to be a set. In particualr we are talking about the set $S$ with elements $a$ $b$ and $c$.

## Be carfull
The order is not important meaninig that given two vectors:
$$ A = \{1,2,3\} \quad B = \{1,3,2,1\} $$
$$ A = B $$

# Essentials of Set Theory II

## Let's elaborate it a little more...
The notation we used previously usefull with short sets but what about big sets and infinite sets? We need to use  a different notation defining the property of the set:
